# TictacToe_Game_with_sound
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid to form a line of their symbols ('X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first to do so wins.

# !!!! Game Rules !!!!

# Game Board:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, resulting in 9 cells.

# Players:
Two players participate, often denoted as Player 1 ("X") and Player 2 ("O"). Player 1 typically starts the game.

# Taking Turns:
Players take turns to make their moves. Player 1 goes first, followed by Player 2, and they continue to alternate turns throughout the game.

# Making a Move:
During their turn, a player selects an empty cell on the grid to place their symbol. They do this by specifying the position using a numbering system, usually from 1 to 9.

# Valid Moves:
Players can only place their symbol in an empty cell. They cannot overwrite a cell that has already been filled by their opponent.

Winning Condition: The game is won when a player successfully forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols, as follows:
Horizontal Line: Three of their symbols in a row (e.g., across the top row: 1, 2, 3).
Vertical Line: Three of their symbols in a column (e.g., down the left column: 1, 4, 7).
Diagonal Line: Three of their symbols diagonally (e.g., from top-left to bottom-right: 1, 5, 9, or from top-right to bottom-left: 3, 5, 7).
Draw Condition: If all cells on the grid are filled, and no player has won, the game is declared a draw. This means that neither player has formed a winning combination, and the game ends in a tie.

# Game Over:
The game ends when either a player wins or the game is drawn. The players may choose to play additional rounds if desired.
